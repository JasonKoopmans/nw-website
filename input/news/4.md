We need you! As a Secret Pal you pray daily and send correspondence each month to your pal. 
Please let us know by September 7 if you would be a Secret Pal for this yearâ€™s WNCS.    
If you have any questions feel free to let us know.  
It was a success last year but we need more people from our church family to sign up.  
The kids sure thought having a secret pal was something special.
You can email us at poynetteinchumc1@gmail.com.
You can call Jo Wheeler at 608-279-0961 
or Michele Koopmans at 608-225-4305.

We have at least 60 kids in our program so please let me know you will help out with this!
